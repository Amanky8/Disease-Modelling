## ðŸ”Ž Project Overview  
This project focused on building a **reactionâ€“diffusion model** for corneal wound healing regulated by **Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF)**. The model describes how EGF concentration and cell density evolve during the healing process, incorporating mechanisms such as **migration, mitosis, and degradation**.  

The work was implemented and solved using **COMSOL Multiphysics**, providing numerical solutions and visualisations of the wound closure process.

## ðŸ§© Key Contributions  
- Formulated **coupled PDEs** to capture spatio-temporal dynamics of EGF and epithelial cells.  
- Simulated wound closure patterns by accounting for **cell migration, proliferation, and degradation**.  
- Demonstrated how **growth factor signalling** influences healing dynamics.  
- Utilised **COMSOL Multiphysics** for solution and visualisation.

## ðŸ”„ Broader Aim  
This work was designed not only to study corneal wound healing but also to explore **how mathematical models can describe biological healing and regeneration processes**.  

Building on this foundation, the next step of the research is to extend these concepts towards **modelling human fatty liver regeneration** â€“ focusing on hepatocyte state transitions, growth factor regulation, and tissue recovery dynamics.
