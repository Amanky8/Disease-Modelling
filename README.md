**Mathematical Modelling of Corneal Wound Healing**  
*Under the guidance of Dr. Ganesh Madabattula, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT BHU Varanasi*  
*Feb 2025 â€“ Apr 2025*  

- Focused on a **reaction-diffusion model** for corneal wound healing regulated by **Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF)**.  
- Implemented **coupled PDEs** for EGF concentration and cell density, incorporating **migration, mitosis, and degradation** dynamics.  
- Utilized **COMSOL Multiphysics** for numerical solution and visualization of the healing process.
