## ðŸ”Ž Project Overview  
- Studied a **reactionâ€“diffusion model** of epithelial wound healing regulated by **epidermal growth factor (EGF)**.  
- Simulated **coupled PDEs** for EGF and cell density, incorporating **migration, mitosis, and degradation**.  
- Exploring **modelling approaches** for fatty liver disease to understand mechanisms of **liver regeneration**.

## ðŸ”„ Broader Aim  
This work was designed not only to study corneal wound healing but also to explore **how mathematical models can describe biological healing and regeneration processes**.  

Building on this foundation, the next step of the research is to extend these concepts towards **modelling human fatty liver regeneration** â€“ focusing on hepatocyte state transitions, growth factor regulation, and tissue recovery dynamics.
